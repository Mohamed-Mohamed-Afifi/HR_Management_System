## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
![ERD Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=HR+ERD+Diagram)
- **Entities**:
  - **Employee**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `department_id` (FK to Department).
  - **Department**: `id`, `name`, `manager_id` (FK to Employee).
  - **Project**: `id`, `name`, `start_date`, `end_date`.
  - **Dependent**: `id`, `name`, `relationship`, `employee_id` (FK to Employee).
  - **User**: `id`, `username`, `password`, `role_id` (FK to Role).
  - **Role**: `id`, `name` (e.g., Admin, HR Manager, Employee).
  - **Token**: `id`, `token`, `user_id` (FK to User).

- **Relationships**:
  - An employee belongs to one department (1:N).
  - An employee can have multiple dependents (1:N).
  - Employees work on multiple projects (N:M via `employee_project` table).
